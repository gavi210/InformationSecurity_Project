# InformationSecurity_Project
This is the repository that contains the code for the Information Security Project. 

## Repo Organisation
The repository is organized into 3 main branches: 
- **unsafe_app**: it contains the code of the initial application version, where no security mechanisms have been implemented,
- **safe_app**: it contains the code for the secured application, where the identified security threats have been hopefully solved, (note that encryption and decryption
are not supported here)
- **encryption_feature**: it contains the code for the secured application and support for email encryption/ decryption and body signature. 

## How to install the application
In each branch you will find the respective README.md file explaining how to install, set-up and use the application.
